  abstract="Ongoing galaxy surveys map the Universe’s large-scale structure with unprecedented fidelity across unprecedented volumes. They promise to significantly deepen our understanding of the Universe, though this potential hinges on our ability to tackle systematic uncertainties. Until recently, this was beyond reach in implicit cosmological inference frameworks. In this talk, I present the first framework to uncover and correct model misspecification in field-based, implicit likelihood cosmological inference. Our approach proceeds in two steps. First, we infer the initial matter power spectrum using the SELFI algorithm, and use it to conduct a thorough simulation-based analysis of a range of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single, joint suite of N-body simulations. Second, we perform implicit likelihood inference of cosmological parameters using a realistic forward model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy survey that incorporates non-linear gravitational evolution with N-body. I show how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias, selection functions, survey masks, and redshift errors on the reconstructed initial power spectrum. I further show that percent-order misspecification may shift constraints by as much as 2σ in the (Ωₘ, σ₈) plane—biases our framework can now expose and avoid. This marks a critical step towards robust cosmological inference from full forward models of galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.",

I further show that percent-order misspecification can lead to a bias greater than 2σ in the (Ωₘ, σ₈) plane, which we are able to detect and avoid using SELFI prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full-forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.",
