     abstract = "{Context. The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to
        substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This
        potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic
        uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to
        inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in
        field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference
        frameworks. Aims. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of
        systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring
        cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power
        spectrum. Methods. Our approach is built upon a two-step
        framework. First, we employed the simulator expansion for
        likelihood-free inference (SELFI) algorithm to infer the initial
        matter power spectrum, which we utilised to thoroughly
        investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation
        relies on a single set of N-body simulations. Second, we
        obtained a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit
        likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first
        step for data compression. As a demonstration, we relied on a
        model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that
        incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution with
        COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) and simulates multiple
        systematic effects encountered in real surveys. Results. We
        provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used
        to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters,
        selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and
        approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power
        spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a
        bias exceeding 2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in the
        ({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$, {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$)
        plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring
        cosmological parameters. Conclusions. This framework has the
        potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical
        information extraction from full forward models of large-scale
        galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.}",

abstract={Purpose Vortices are ubiquitous in fluid flows, yet accurately preserving their dynamics in numerical simulations over extended timescales and distances remains challenging. Discretisation schemes often introduce artificial dissipation exceeding physical viscosity, flattening vortical structures and disrupting their delicate dynamics. This paper aims to introduce a vorticity confinement correction for discontinuous Galerkin discretisation methods, designed to enhance the fidelity of direct numerical simulations of unsteady, vortex-dominated flows at arbitrarily high orders of accuracy. Design/methodology/approach This approach builds upon the classical VC2 correction for finite volume schemes, incorporating an additional volumetric correction specific to the discontinuous Galerkin discretisation. Findings This paper shows through an isentropic vortex transport problem that the vorticity confinement correction substantially improves vorticity conservation, evaluated here at second- and third-order spatial accuracies. This paper further demonstrates a significant gain in preserving both large and small vortices in three-dimensional transitional turbulence at second-order spatial accuracy. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a Vorticity Confinement method is developed and evaluated in the context of discontinuous Galerkin schemes.},

  abstract="Differences in cellsâ€™ functions arise from differential activity of regulatory elements, including
enhancers. Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that cooperate with promoters through
transcription factors (TF) to activate the expression of one or several genes by getting physically
close to them in the 3D space of the nucleus. There is increasing evidence that genetic variants
associated with common diseases are enriched in enhancers active in cell types relevant to these
diseases. Identifying the enhancers associated with genes and conversely, the sets of genes
activated by each enhancer (the so-called enhancer/gene or E/G relationships) across cell types,
can help understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying human diseases.
There are three broad approaches for the genome-wide identification of E/G relationships in a
cell type: (1) genetic link methods or eQTL, (2) functional link methods based on 1D functional
data such as open chromatin, histone mark or gene expression and (3) spatial link methods
based on 3D data such as HiC. Since (1) and (3) are costly, the current strategy is to develop
functional link methods and to use data from (1) and (3) as reference to evaluate them. However,
there is still no consensus on the best functional link method to date, and method comparison
remain seldom.
Here, we compared the relative performances of three recent methods for the identification of18
enhancer-gene links, TargetFinder, Average-Rank, and the ABC model, using the three19
latest benchmarks from the field: a reference that combines 3D and eQTL data, called BENGI,20
and two genetic screening references, called CRiFF and CRiSPRi. Overall, none of the three21
methods performed best on the three references. CRiFF and CRISPRi reference sets are likely22
more reliable, but CRiFF is not genome-wide and CRiFF and CRISPRi are mostly available on23
the K562 cancer cell line. The BENGI reference set is genome-wide but likely contains many false24
positives. This study therefore calls for new reliable and genome-wide E/G reference data rather25
than new functional link E/G identification methods.",

  abstract="To build an augmented view of an organ during surgery, it is essential to have a biomechanical model with appropriate material parameters and boundary conditions, able to match patient specific properties. Adaptation to the patient's anatomy is obtained by exploiting the image-rich context specific to our application domain. While information about the organ shape, for instance, can be obtained preoperatively, other patient-specific parameters can only be determined intraoperatively. To this end, we are developing data-driven simulations, which exploit information extracted from a stream of medical images. Such simulations need to run in realtime. To this end we have developed dedicated numerical methods, which allow for real-time computation of finite element simulations.",
